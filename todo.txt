check 'support' area for structure tensor
line threshholds; falloff.

1AGW's true sample resolution. it's fineness could be a source of slowness, as well.

/* Things to check / vary:

   Resolution
   Line length (and whether to limit it at all, on t2,t3 -
     but that's just a speed thing)
   density falloff
 - for speed, the degree of the interpolation.

   get to grips with the formula!

   How do I know I have the true local maximae? Is there another way,
   how does the paper do it?

   * Find way to tune Gaussian support. SigmaOfGaussian, supposed to be
     the same as the feature size.
   * Look at their data
   * translate the support for gaussian, from physical.
      ('too_small') - ach, just give it a surviving size

   * The big time-saver would be to convert from double to float.

   * Work on triangularization, skeletonization
     - because, this way I can automate the search for good parameters.

   * subtract out the alphas' contributions!
